# Label Combinations


The first task is to set up a set of label sets that mix FTW labels with
Lacuna labels in varying formats. Some of the factors to consider are
discussed in issue
[\#1](https://github.com/agroimpacts/ftw-mappingafrica-integration/issues/1),
and we will sketch them out here in more detail.
<a href="#tbl-labelsets" class="quarto-xref">Table 1</a> describes the
band combination sets, but not the training/validation/test subsets to
compose from each.
